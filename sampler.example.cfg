[system]
active = if this system is currently being run (True/False)
jobname = prefix for slurm jobs
rootdir = root directory with other folders in it
scriptdir = /scratch/PI/rondror/rbetz/adaptivesampling/
featurized = path to featurized file with %d substituted for generation number
ligands = comma separated list of ligand resnames
num_ligands = number of ligands in the system

parameters = comma separated parameter files for dabble
topologies = comma separated topology files for dabble
minligdist = minimum separation between ligands (10.0 A)
minprotdist = minimum separation between ligand and protein (2.5 A)
solvent = solvent to use. Say either TIP3 or DEFAULT (for membrane)
excludesel = <deprecated>

[model]
num_clusters = number of initial clusters (300)
num_tics = number of tica components to retain (15)

[production]
generation = generation number we're on (start at 1, auto updates)
max_generation = stop running after this generation has been MSM'd
runlength = number of ns to run each simulation (100)
runpercent = percentage of runs that must reach minimum to do next generation range 0->1 (.9)

submissions = minimum number of production jobs to keep in queue (5)
pressure = semiisotropic/isotropic/anisotropic (semiisotropic)
hmr = boolean if HMR should be used. Defaults to TRUE
extra_options = extra lines in the production mdin file go here (\n delimited). Good for aMD.
